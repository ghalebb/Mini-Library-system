- Library.java - contains the library implementation and the main method of the program

- Patron.java - This class represents a library patron that has a name and assigns values
to different literary aspects of books.

- Book.java - This class represents a book, which has a title, author, year of publication
and different literary aspects.

=          Design           =
=============================
I implemented tho book class in a way the can be reused, that is, when the library
wants to get rid of the book or give it to other patron, it only reset the book Id and the borrower ID.
and I implemented the book and patron IDs in a way that can be easy, which means the the book number or
the patron is just the number of when they were added
to the shelve or registered to the library.
I chose this design because it is similar to real world libraries and it is easy for use

=============================
In the Library class I chose arrays to store both book objects and patrons
and the number of the index of the object in the array is its id number
